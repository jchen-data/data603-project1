# data603-project1

Main code is as follows:

1) Face: Pr1main.mlx
2) Pose: Pr1pose.mlx

These both depend on the function contained in mykNN.m
myPCA.m is deprecated for in-line readability in the two scripts

I probably should've wrapped the two main scripts into functions to make the code cleaner, but I started off making temporary looping versions of the scripts to visualize the accuracy and was already committed by the time I realized this. I included these temporary scripts as well for completeness.
